    <br>the net part filled in 1 hour = (1/x-1/y) if y>x

    <b>TIME & DISTANCE :</b>
    <br>
    1.Distance = Speed * Time
    <br>2.1 km/hr = 5/18 m/sec
    <br>3.1 m/sec = 18/5 km/hr
    <br>4.Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x kmph and an equal distance at y kmph. Then, the average speed during the whole journey is 2xy/(x+y) kmph.
    <br>
    <b>PROBLEMS ON TRAINS :</b>
    <br>1.Time taken by a train x metres long in passing a signal post or a pole or a standing man is equal to the time taken by the train to cover x metres.
    <br>2.Time taken by a train x metres long in passing a stationary object of length y metres is equal to the time taken by the train to cover x+y metres.
    <br>3.Suppose two trains are moving in the same direction at u kmph and v kmph such that u>v, then their relative speed = u-v kmph.
    <br>4.If two trains of length x km and y km are moving in the same direction at u kmph and v kmph, where u>v, then time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train = (x+y)/(u-v) hours.
    <br>5.Suppose two trains are moving in opposite directions at u kmph and v kmph. Then, their relative speed = (u+v) kmph.
    <br>6.If two trains of length x km and y km are moving in the opposite directions at u kmph and v kmph, then time taken by the trains to cross each other = (x+y)/(u+v)hours.
    <br>7.If two trains start at the same time from two points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b hours in reaching B and A respectively, then A's speed : B's speed = (vb : v
